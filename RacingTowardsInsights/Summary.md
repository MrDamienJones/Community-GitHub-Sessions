# Abstract

[Sessionize Page](https://sessionize.com/s/damienjones/racing-towards-insights-analysing-the-sale-sizzler/74895)

In this session, I explore the capabilities of the Visual Studio Code Data Wrangler extension and Microsoft Power BI using real results from the Sale Sizzler 5k race series. I'll uncover valuable insights through engaging visualisations and user-friendly and low-code data transformations.

This session will cover the following key steps:

- Discovering the convenience of the Visual Studio Code Data Wrangler extension for effortlessly transforming and cleaning the race results

- Taking a closer look at the Python code generated by Data Wrangler to understand what's happening behind the scenes.

- Loading the transformed race results into Power BI to generate informative visualisations and analyse trends.

Join me if you're a data professional, a budding analyst or a sports enthusiast!
