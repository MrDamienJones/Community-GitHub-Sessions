# Community Sessions

Resources for sessions I've presented.

## Description

This repo is intended for sharing resources used in my community sessions.

## Getting Started

### Contents

This repo holds resources used in the construction and delivery of sessions I have produced.  Objects may include:

- Code
- Data (where sharable and in compliance with GDPR etc)
- Links 
- Presentation Slides (as PDF)
- Third Party Resources

Plus other relevant files.

### Navigation

**Top level** folders identify the session **title**.

**Sub-Folders** hold objects used when a session has been **presented**.

To avoid repetition, new Sub-Folders are only created if objects *change*. 

E.G. if a talk is presented in:

- 2023-11
- 2024-05
- 2024-07 
- 2024-11 

And the 2024-11 presentation needs new text, there will be folders for:

- 2023-11
- 2024-11

The prior 2024 dates will reference the **2023-11** folder.  

> If in doubt, the most recent folder should be most suitable.
