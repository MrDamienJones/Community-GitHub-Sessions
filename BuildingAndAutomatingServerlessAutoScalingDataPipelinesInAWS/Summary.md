The modern data professional navigates a dynamic data landscape, handling high-velocity raw data at ever-changing volumes. In this 30-minute intermediate session, I demonstrate a fully serverless auto-scaling data pipeline using AWS services.

This session includes:

- Getting and storing API data with AWS Lambda and Amazon S3.
- Transforming the API data with AWS Glue &amp; Amazon Athena.
- Pipeline automation and orchestration with AWS Step Functions and Amazon EventBridge.

Ideal for Data, DevOps, and Architecture professionals, this session offers practical insights into building efficient serverless data pipelines. Join to enhance your skills and explore the latest in Data Engineering and AWS.
